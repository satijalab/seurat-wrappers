\title{Fit a Multinomial Topic Model Using fastTopics}
\usage{
FitTopicModel(
  object,
  k = 3,
  assay = NULL,
  features = NULL,
  reduction.name = "multinom_topic_model",
  reduction.key = "k_",
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A Seurat object.}

\item{k}{The number of topics. Must be 2 or more.}

\item{assay}{Name of assay to use; defaults to the default
assay of the object.}

\item{features}{A list of features to use for fitting the model. If
\code{features = NULL}, \emph{all} features are used; see
\code{\link[Seurat]{VariableFeatures}}. NOTE: EXPAND ON THIS.}

\item{reduction.name}{Name of the outputted reduction.}

\item{reduction.key}{Key for the outputted reduction.}

\item{verbose}{When \code{verbose = TRUE}, information about the
progress of the model fitting is printed to the console. See
\code{\link[fastTopics]{fit_poisson_nmf}} for an explanation of the
output.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments passed to \code{fit_topic_model};
see \code{\link[fastTopics]{fit_topic_model}} for details.}
}
\value{
A Seurat object with the multinomial topic model fit stored
as a \code{\link[Seurat]{DimReduc}} object. The cell embeddings
are the mixture proportions, stored as an n x k matrix in the
\code{cell.embeddings} slot, where n is the number of cells, and k
is the number of topics.  This is the same as the \code{L} matrix
output in \code{fit_topic_model}.

The feature loadings (the \code{feature.loadings} slot) are an m x
k matrix in which column i is the vector of relative gene
expression levels in topic i. This is the same as the \code{F}
output in \code{fit_topic_model}.

Apply \code{\link[Seurat]{Misc}} to the \code{DimReduce} object to
access the \dQuote{"multinom_topic_model_fit"} object outputted by
\code{\link[fastTopics]{fit_topic_model}}, which contains more
information about the model fit; see the example for an
illustration of how to do this, and see
\code{\link[fastTopics]{fit_topic_model}} more information about
the "multinom_topic_model_fit" object.

An additional PCA dimension reduction is provided to, for example,
quickly visualize the cells using
\code{\link[Seurat]{DimPlot}}. The principal components are
computed from the topic model mixture proportions. However, this is
for convenience only, and we recommend extracting the
\dQuote{"multinom_topic_model_fit"} object and dedicated
visualization tools such \code{\link[fastTopics]{structure_plot}}
that are provided in the fastTopics package.

NOTE: There are only k - 1 PCs.

\description{
Fits a multinomial topic model to the count data,
  hiding most of the complexities of model fitting. The default
  optimization settings used here are intended to work well in a wide
  range of data sets, although some fine-tuning may be needed for
  more difficult cases.
}
\details{
The topic model can be understood as a dimensionality
reduction, in which the mixture proportions matrix, \code{L}, an n
x k matrix, defines a projection of the cells onto a
(kâ€“1)-dimension space (n is the number of cells and k is the number
of topics). Therefore, we use the mixture proportions to define the
\dQuote{cell embedding} in the \code{DimReduc} object.

There is a confusing bit of terminology here, because "loadings"
means something different depending on the context In fastTopics,
the \code{L} matrix is sometimes referred to as the "loadings
matrix" (this is the convention used in factor analysis), but it is
\emph{not} the same as the "feature loadings" matrix used here,
which adopts the convention used for principal component
analysis. To avoid confusion, we only refer to \code{L} as the
mixture proportions matrix.

See \code{\link[fastTopics]{fit_topic_model}} for more details.

\examples{
library(Seurat)
library(fastTopics)
set.seed(1)

# Load the PBMC data.
data(pbmc_small)

# Fit the multinomial topic model to the raw UMI count data; no
# pre-processing is needed. 
pbmc_small <- FitTopicModel(pbmc_small,k = 3)

# This plot shows the cells projected onto the 2 principal
# components (PCs) of the topic model mixture proportions.
DimPlot(pbmc_small,reduction = "pca_topics")

# Compare against PCA performed on the transformed count data.
DimPlot(pbmc_small,reduction = "pca")

# Once fitted topic model is extracted, many functions from the
# fastTopics package can be used. For example, the Structure plot
# provides an evocative visual summary of the estimated mixture
# proportions for each cell.
fit <- Misc(Reductions(pbmc_small,"multinom_topic_model"))
structure_plot(fit,grouping = Idents(pbmc_small),gap = 5)

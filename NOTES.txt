Comments from Alan Selewa:

I was able to run the wrapper on my heart single cell RNA-seq
data. Theres about ~70k cells and 26k genes. Fitting the model took
about 4 hours using 16 Rcpp parallel threads. Heres some thoughts on
the process:

FitTopicModel would benefit from more hyper-parameters in its
interface, like number of EM iterations to perform, number of parallel
threads to use, etc. Basically anything youâ€™d pass to fastTopics
should be available in the interface, in my opinion.

I would add a function that works on the Seurat object to plot
log-likelihood vs iteration (similar to Seurat::ElbowPlot).

It seems that downstream analyses (structure_plot, differential
expression) will work directly on the fit produced. In conformity with
everything else Seurat-related, I think these functions should work
directly on the Seurat object, rather than extracting the fit object,
and running functions found in fastTopics.

The topic proportion of each cell should be visualized with
Seurat::FeaturePlots e.g. topic 1 proportion overlayed on a UMAP as I
shown in the vignette below add a wrapper function for visualizing
gene proportion in each topic.
